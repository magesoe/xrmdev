I have long thought Dataverse development is a solved problem. In that, there is a definite best solution to any problem. The only issue so far has been categorizing problems and their solutions.

This site aims to be opinionated and transparent in the knowledge that is shared. All knowledge will be brief and direct. All solutions will be written under the assumption that the skill of a development team is unbounded. Therefore, you always have to weigh whether the correct solution depicted here is something your own team has the skills to deliver.

## Opinionated
One issue with the previous attempts at knowledge gathering has been the word "it depends". This allows the author to be vague and hide what is yet unknown. This site aims to say something concrete about any situation. If there are multiple valid solutions, then the conditions for when they are valid will be presented.

This allows critique to be concrete, and through that I hope we will eventually arrive at the best way to develop for Power Apps and Dataverse.

## Transparent
This site is public on GitHub. Anyone can submit a PR or raise an issue on something the site has got wrong. I will bring in the new knowledge, such that any alternatives are shown. 

If another solution to a problem is not better, then it is simply listed along with the reason why it is worse.

If it is better under some conditions, then the knowledge is updated.

If the solution is better in any case, all previous solutions will be listed along with the reason why they are now worse.

## Guidelines
Solutions on this site will aim to reduce complicatedness while allowing for high complexity.
This means the life of a developer working with Power Apps and Dataverse should be able to build a solution that solves a business need of any complexity level as simple as possible.
It should be as hard as possible to
* Make a mistake during development
* Break existing implementation

It should be as easy as possible to
* Work with multiple developers
* Deploy implementations to production
